Eggs, of course! Use the freshest ones you can find, from a local source if possible (we like Vital Farms). The fresher your eggs are, the sunnier, creamier, and more flavorful your scramble will be.
Milk, plant milk, or water – I whisk a little into the eggs before I cook them. This additional moisture makes the eggs extra-soft and creamy. If you use plant milk, make sure to pick one with a neutral flavor. I recommend unsweetened almond milk.
Extra-virgin olive oil or butter, for the pan. I always use olive oil because it’s what I keep handy. But butter works well too – it’ll add rich flavor to this recipe.
Salt…
And pepper! To add depth of flavor to these simple scrambled eggs.
